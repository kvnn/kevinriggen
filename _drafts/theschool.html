The school defined

We can build a school that allows anyone to reach their full potential in life.

This is an introduction to that school.

 

The fundamentals

Curiousity, open source resources, and science.

Sugatra Mitra has defined an environment that promotes the most productive learning process for groups of children. The main goals are to construct an environment that stimulates curiosity and to allow the children to find solutions to problems without instruction. His experiments show that the optimal system is having groups of four children sharing a computer to solve a difficult problem together. His methods have shown an increase in the standardized test scores and in the retention rates of the children. These are measurable criteria, and the results have been published by Mitra.

The Khan academy is an incredible resource for students and teachers. It allows anyone with access to the internet to watch high quality lectures on a multitude of subjects. Children are now free to watch good lectures on their own time and at their own pace, and teachers are free to help students with actual work instead of preparing and delivering lectures.

Neuroscience, the science of the brain, has shown us some interesting characteristics of how we learn.



 

Requirements

The school is a complete success if :

The structures, resources and methods that make up the school are as easy as possible to reproduce: It must be reproduceable.
It must consider the physical and mental health of every member using data from scientific studies and social experiments. It must be healthy.
It must teach people marketable skills. It must be relevant.
It must embrace the fleeting nature of life. It must be fun.

Sugatra Mitra, The Child-Driven Education

"I basically embedded a computer into a wall of a slum in New Delhi. The children barely went to school. They didn't know any English. They'd never seen a computer before,and they didn't know what the internet was. I connected high speed internet to it -- it's about three feet off the ground -- turned it on and left it there."

"I'm about providing the means to build something that will grow and intensify its original investment and not just require greater giving next year -- I'm not trying to feed the habit."

Salman Khan, Lets use video to reinvent education

"And the teachers would write, saying, "We use your videos to flip the classroom. You've given the lectures, so now what we do ... " and this could happen in every classroom in America tomorrow, " ... what I do is I assign the lectures for homework. And what used to be homework, I now have the students doing in the classroom."
