Chomsky on Occupy Wall Street

[a summary]



SUMMARY : If the 99.9% is going to have a better future, pressure must be put on the political administration to make decisions that enact that better future. Occupy Wall Street has the potential to do this. The biggest factor in whether there will be enough pressure to make a change is longevity, widespread support and strategy.



"It's spectacular. It's unprecedented; there's never been anything like it."



"If the bonds and associations that are being established at these remarkable events can be sustained through a long, hard period ahead -- because victories don't come quickly-- this could turn out to be a very significant moment in American history."



"The fact that the demonstrations are unprecedented is quite appropriate. It is an unprecedented era ... since the 1970s ... there’s kind of a pervasive sense of [hopelessness]. I think it’s quite new in American history and it has an objective basis."



"In the 1930s unemployed 'working people' could anticipate realistically that the jobs are going to come back. If you’re a worker in manufacturing today ... then those jobs aren’t going to come back."



[ A very informative and concise explanation of what has happened to American economy, politics and class structure from the 1960's to the present time ].



"Take a look at what’s happening right now. The big topic in Washington that everyone concentrates on is the deficit... The public overwhelmingly supports higher taxes on the wealthy, which have declined sharply during this stagnation period [from the 1970s on] ... The outcome of the deficit commission is probably going to be the opposite... The Occupy movements could provide a mass base for trying to avert what amounts to a dagger in the heart of the country, and having negative effects."



The last sentence here is very interesting : The Occupy movement could cause actual change to the American economy in a way that the public majority supports.



"What’s being played out for the last 30 years is actually a kind of a nightmare that was anticipated by the classical economists." [ examples by Adam Smith and David Ricardo talking about the harmful effects of manufacturers doing business in, importing from and investing abroad ].



"So pick Citigroup, for decades one of the most corrupt of the major investment banking corporations. It was repeatedly bailed out by the taxpayer over and over again starting in the early Reagan years and now once again".



"A couple of years ago they came out with a brochure for investors. They urged investors to put their money in what they call the 'plutonomy index'. The world is dividing into a plutonomy [Economic growth that is powered and consumed by the wealthiest upper class of society] .... They said their plutonomy index is way outperforming the stock market, so put your money into it. And as for the rest [99.9% of the population] ? We set them adrift. We don’t really care about them and we don’t need them. They have to be around to provide a powerful state to protect us and bail us out when we get into trouble, but they essentially have no function."



"This is considered a good thing... [Alan Greenspan] said much of this economy was based on what he called 'growing worker insecurity'... they’re not going to make demands, they won’t make wages, they won’t get benefits ... That’s what’s called a healthy economy technically and he was highly praised for this."



"The Occupy movements are the first major popular reaction which could avert this. It’s going to be necessary to face the fact that it’s a long hard struggle."



Chomsky offers his strategic opinion :



"In 1977, US Steel decided to close one of its major facilities, Youngstown, Ohio, and instead of just walking away, the workforce and the community decided to get together and buy it from US Steel and hand it over to the workforce to run and turn it into a worker-owned, worker-managed facility. They didn’t win, but with enough popular support they could have won."



"There’s a scattering of hundreds, maybe thousands, of not-so-small worker owned or partially worker-owned industries which could become worker-managed. That’s the basis for a real revolution. That’s how it takes place."



"It’s happening here, too. In one of the suburbs of Boston something similar happened. A multi-national decided to shut down a productive, functioning and profitable manufacturing company because it was not profitable enough for them. The workforce and union offered to buy it and take it over and run it themselves, but the multi-national decided to close it down instead probably for reasons of class consciousness."



"I had to take a train from Avignon in southern France to the airport in Paris and it took two hours. That’s the same distance as Washington to Boston ... [regarding a high-speed rail] the Obama administration was sending its transportation secretary to Spain to get contracts for developing high-speed rails for the United States. This could have been done right in the Rust Belt, which is being closed down. There’s no economic reason this can’t happen. These are class reasons and the lack of political mobilization."



So more political mobilization by the working class could have prompted the Obama administration to use U.S. workers for a high speed rail that would benefit the economy, instead of awarding contracts in another country.



Chomsky goes on to say that nuclear catastrophe and environmental catastrophe are emerging threats to our species, but they and the scientists providing the proof are being ignored and treated as "a liberal hoax" by the administration ... We’re really regressing back to the Medieval period. It’s not a joke. If that’s happening to the most powerful and richest country in history then this crisis is not going to be averted and all of this we’re talking about won’t matter in a generation or two."
