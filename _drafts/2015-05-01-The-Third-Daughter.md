title: The Third Daughter
---

My third daughter is about to be born, and I'm scared. I'm very fucking scared. Not because something might go wrong - I'm confident nothing will - but because when everything is settled, I'm going to be a new person. I'm just not really completely ready for that. 

You see, my new daughter is going to change my world in ways unimaginable. I truly cannot imagine how. There is a slight, brittle feeling that I can evoke but it's about as useful as imagining what death must be like. I'm left pathetically trying to prepare for a transcendental experience whose process is one completely out of my conscious control, and whose outcome is something like myself but quite a bit better and much more enriched.
