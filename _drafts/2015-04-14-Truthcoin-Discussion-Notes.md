title: Truthcoin Discussions

In an effort to better understand Truthcoin, I've collated and made notes on relevant discussions. Many of these discussions take place between the author of Truthcoin, Paul Sztorc, and others.



##  Reddit Introduction #1

u/Anderkent: *Secondary, the 'vote what you think most people will vote' seems like it could suffer to the false consensus effect. That might not be the case for trivially checkable facts though, which is what you incentivise people to actually bet on.*

Sztorc: *Yes you understand it perfectly. Consensus failure is treated as "The Author's Problem", where traders would lose at most half of their money (by thinking the market price is 1 when in reality it resets to half post-failure). Authors, however, lose all of their money, so one would expect them to strategically respond to this incentive by not ever creating a market that would be difficult to adjudicate. So in theory I've pushed this problem backwards through time to the point of its creation, which is all I could think to do.*

u/mrmishmashmix: *I presume the major difference between what you're suggesting and what already exists (www.predictious.com etc etc) is the decentralised nature of the market*

Sztorc: *You are absolutely correct. I love that we have predictious but trusting any third party, including a website, goes against Satoshi's vision of a P2P currency. Although Bitcoin is P2P it isn't used as such enough (yet).*

- There was quite an entertaining but relatively useless argument between Sztorc and historian1111.
