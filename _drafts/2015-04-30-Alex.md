Title: Alex
---

Alex was our dog. My now wife and I drove to Compton, from our peaceful suburb, to buy her for $250 from a low-income Black neighborhood. A nice young boy walked us through the house, past his grandma in a rocking sofa, into the garage where the 4-week old puppies were wrestling on a blanket. Alex was the runt, and couldn't use her back legs very well (years later we discovered that she had broken her spine).


## The teenagers-having-sex-in-the-truck incident
In my early twenties I trained Thai boxing and would go for runs with Alex on the dirt road behind my parents' house. The road was private property but never patrolled, and the whole area was a hotbed of off-roaring, shooting, horseback riding and parting.
