## What if Google bought a prison?
What would the outcome be? How would extremely intelligent and well-organized Google engineers solve the problem of criminal rehabilitation differently than the status quo? How would prisoners and society be affected?

## How about a prison startup? Why don't we get into that game?

###1. Why the fuck would we?
Thats a good question.

Prisons are broken because they don't rehabilitate convicts into valuable citizens [citation needed].

Money is made when you fix problems for a market [citation needed].
