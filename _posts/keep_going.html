1. You've learned something by failing

Failing is hard and valuable. There is a reason that you failed, which means there is a void in conduct that you can fill. Fill that void, try again, and you'll either succeed or discover yet another void (there are a lot).

 

2. Randomness

Whatever you've been doing, randomness is significant.

If you have a good idea, make good decisions and are industrious - there is a chance that you will hit a home run and a chance that you fail.

The game here is to have a possible home run as often as possible. Its like "Luck surface area" - http://www.codusoperandi.com/posts/increasing-your-luck-surface-area - for success.

 

3. Some tips

Some of us fail most often with vision, and some fail most often with implementation. Its important to know which one you're weak in, because you need to be very critical during that phase of the process.

Personally, I'm gifted at implementation. I fail most often with keeping a vision that I like and that will be sustainable. For example, I may implement an awesome video sharing community web application, but have no solid monetization route. I may have a few options, and a "when I have hundreds of thousands of users people will push money at me", but that is foolish. Don't be foolish, be hard and be critical.
