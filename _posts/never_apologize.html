Always do your best and never apologize.

If you are hell bent on getting better, than failure cannot be a barrier to your motivation. Failure is essential to learning, and apologizing for the essential is a fools errand.

Don't let doubt creep into your mind after you fail. Take a hard, critical look at your methods regularly and refine your methods based on the whole story. Your successes and your failures are the end point of a more important path. What was the beginning? What steps did you take to the end? What opportunities and random events transpired?

Why is the path more important than the end point?

Because our reality is continuous. There are new systems to hack and there is another game to play tomorrow.

Because you learn continuously. The thirty steps leading up to a goal are thirty points of learning, and the goal itself is one.
