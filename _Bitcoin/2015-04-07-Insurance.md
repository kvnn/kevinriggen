title: Using blockchains for insurance
---

These are my rough notes on "Chain Of A Lifetime: How Blockchain Technology Might Transform Personal Insurance", available at [{{ site.url }}/files/Chain_Of_A_Lifetime_December2014.pdf]({{ site.url }}/files/Chain_Of_A_Lifetime_December2014.pdf) by Michael Mainelli and Chiara von Gunten at [Long Finance](http://www.longfinance.net/). They reflect my personal beliefs and interests of [Bitcoin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin) and [blockchain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#Block_chain) technology as related to [Insurance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance).

> "Blockchain-based apps could support the automation of insurance products based on betting-like insurance products & financial derivative contracts"

> "Crop insurance could be automated through a smart contract hosted on a blockchain protocol & using an oracle, such as a trusted weather feed"

##The four themes
There are four themes of insurance that a blockchain would have great effect upon:

     THEME              RELEVANT BLOCKCHAIN COMPONENT
     ----------         --------------------------------------
    1. Identity  <----> Authentication
    2. Space     <----> Transactions
    3. Time      <----> Debts
    4. Mutuality <----> Communities


##Identity
>"What if you had a portable, secure globally available store of personal information... that could be shared partially to trusted third parties for things like health insurance claims or rental car quotes..."

- blockchain tech could be used to manage identities & personal information
    - personal data storage & management
    - permission frameworks for access
    - distributed reputation ratings
- trusted third parties who store & manage identities & personal info could be less necessary, if at all
- blockchain tech could reduce identity & claim fraud, increase confidence in products & lower rates
- the concept of "never losing data" could fundamentally change society

##Space
> "What if the importance of regulatory boundaries diminished?"
> "...insurance coverage could be adjusted across space almost instantaneously while catering to 'local' needs"

> "Could support the tailoring of insurance products by expanding the range of products across places & by enabling nearly instantaneous adjustments of insurance coverage & pricing across space & time"

##Time
> "What if when someone dies & the coroner verifies death * the cause of death to their blockchain, their last will & testament is released publicly, their health records are donated to medical research charities & their life insurance policy pays out automatically"

- Blockchain tech could shorten time perception through the tailoring of insurance products across space & time: perhaps specific covereage for the days a person uses their car as a taxi (Uber) or their home a hotel (Airbnb) can be accounted for in their policies.
- Imagine if you could quickly add theft and damage insurance to your car for the day because you had to drive to a high-crime area.

##Mutuality
> "An extensive family in India might provide mutual health insurance to each other, backing it up w/ a combination of recipricol arrangements w/ uncorrelated UK village health schemes"

> "Unemployment insurance could gbe merged w/ educational loans & deals struck over a lifetime..."

- insurers' role could shift over time towards expert advice provision & management of pooling mechanisms
