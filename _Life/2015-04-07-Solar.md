title: My Home Solar Project
---
Electricity for my home is expensive. I live on a 5-[acre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acre) ranch with horses, dogs, parents, children, a wife and a pool. We currently consume ~24,000 [kwH](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilowatt_hour) / year.

## Requirements
- Forty two solar panels of 240W each. This will give me an array of 11.34kW. The generally accepted daily-average of sunlight to the panels in my area is 6 hours. This means that I'll get (6h * 11.34kW) of energy every day, or 68kWh. This comes out to 24,208 kWh per year.
- A 400A electrical panel. My current panel will not handle the above array, and I want the option to power a whole lot of things, so I'm opting for 400A rather than the popular 200A or 200A + solar breaker options.
- A structure for holding the panels.
