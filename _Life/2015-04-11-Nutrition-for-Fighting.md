title: Nutrition for fighting
---
This was written for my cousin Jacob, who is looking to train MMA. I'm not going to provide too many sources because we are genetically similar, I have a lot of personal experience and he trusts what I'm saying. While this is advice I'd give almost any of my male peers, I would give it as a peer and not an authority because *I'm not an authority on the subject*.

## Sleep & Water
- You need the right amount of water and sleep every single day in order to give your body and mind the platform to train hard and to recover
- Your urine should be almost clear
- most people need 8-10 hours to fully recover from something like MMA.

## Calories
- Your body burns calories for energy
- You get calories from eating
- If you eat more calories than you burn, you gain weight. Vice versa.
- It's very difficult to eat too much when you are training MMA and want to maintain or gain weight.
- All calories are protein, carbohydrates or fats.

## Macros

### Overview
- Every single calorie you eat is made of either protein, fats or carbohydrates
- Different mixes of protein, fats and carbohydrates will produce different results for your body. Their is an optimum balance for whatever results you want, and you'll have to find it through experimentation.
    - The amount of desire you have to reach your goal should determine the diligence that you put into your note keeping.
    - If you want gain thirty pounds of muscle, you are going to need to track calories, macros and weight over a period of time spanning *YEARS*, not months
    - If you want to gain five pounds of muscle, you should be able to do it by only tracking your weight and intelligently guessing how much you should eat at any given time
- The bodybuilding community has refined these ideas the most, because they are very concerned with fine-tuning what they put into their body. [There is a lot of good info in this community]([macros](http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/to-macro-or-not-should-you-track-your-macro-intake.html)), but its easy to get way too far into the research & opinions when you could be doing something objectively-productive like hitting bags and eating eggs & oats.
- I recommend that for the first year you just work on discerning what the food you are eating is composed of and noticing how differnt combinations effect you at different times


### Protein
- Protein repairs muscle fibers
- You are going to tear down your muscle fibers  any day that you train hard, and you need enough protein to rebuild them or part of that work was in vain. -- ["There is normally no advantage to consuming more than 0.82g/lb (1.8g/kg) of protein per day to preserve or build muscle"](http://bayesianbodybuilding.com/the-myth-of-1glb-optimal-protein-intake-for-bodybuilders/). So shooting for about 125 grams of protein a day if you are 150 pounds is a good. You can find out how much protein is in certain food on the googles.
- You can supplement your real-food protein consumption with powders, but don't place too much importance on it unless you're finding it difficult to get enough protein in your food

### Carbohydrates & Fats
- Carbohydrates "give you energy". Most of us feel much better expending energy if we've had some [carbohydrates before hand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate_loading). I don't have much else to say about them.
- Fats have been demonized in the past twenty years, apparently because of some bad studies. They are absolutely essential to good nutrition.

### Vegetables & Fruits
- These give you vitamins and nutrients you cannot get elsewhere
- Vitamin supplements are no replacement for these
- Try and eat vegetables at every meal. Make them to your liking. Many vegetables are delicious if cooked correctly. Consult good cooks. Use lots of butter and seasoning.
- You'll get many of your carbohydrates here


### MyFitnessPal

- Again, I recommend [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/) if you want to track macros & calories. They have good pre-sets for gaining muscle, losing fat, etc. They also have a very thorough database of foods & the macros contained in them.

## Creatine
- Barring any [health issues](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatine#Health_effects), Creatine is a harmless and helpful supplement
- It occurs naturally in vertebrates

> "Essentially, creatine helps you lift heavier weight, complete more reps, or both. This elevated work capacity results in an increased ability to develop lean muscle tissue. Because creatine offers an increased capacity for short bursts of energy, athletes in football, hockey, baseball, sprinting, bodybuilding, basketball, or any other sport that requires quick but substantial bursts of energy, benefit from this supplement." - [source](http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/koch1.htm)

- 5 grams / day is good. Don't do the "loading" thing where you take 20 grams / day for a week.

> "Extensive research has shown that oral creatine supplementation at a rate of five to 20 grams per day appears to be very safe and largely devoid of adverse side-effects, while at the same time effectively improving the physiological response to resistance exercise, increasing the maximal force production of muscles in both men and women.[23][24]" - [source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatine)


## Conclusion
- drink enough water
- get enough sleep
- eat the right amount of calories for your goal
    + more than you expend to gain weight
    + less than you expend to lose weight
- eat the right combination of macros
    + *protein*: at least 0.82g for every pound you weigh
    + *carbs & fats*: find the ratio that makes you feel best, or follow a plan for your goal (using MyFitnessPal or a lot of research)
- take 5 grams / creatine a day
